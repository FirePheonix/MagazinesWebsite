# Fix Asset Loading Issues

## Problem
The frontend is trying to load assets with the old base path `/MagazinesWebsite/` instead of the correct path `/`.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated all image paths in `blogConstants.ts`**:
   - Changed from `/MagazinesWebsite/assets/FeaturedArticlesImages/` 
   - To `/assets/FeaturedArticlesImages/`

2. **Fixed Vite configuration**:
   - Set `base: '/'` for Vercel deployment
   - Updated asset build configuration

3. **Updated vercel.json**:
   - Added proper asset routing rules

## Next Steps

### 1. Clear Build Cache
The old build files still have the wrong paths. You need to:

```bash
# In the client directory
cd client
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf node_modules/.vite/
npm run build
```

### 2. Redeploy Frontend
After clearing the cache and rebuilding:

1. Push the updated code to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. The new build will have correct asset paths

### 3. Test the Fix
After redeployment, check:

- [ ] `https://magazines-website-x2ue.vercel.app/` loads without 404 errors
- [ ] Browser console shows no asset loading errors
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] CSS and JS files load properly

## Expected Results

After the fix, your assets should load from:
- ✅ `/assets/index-C_AP5cqt.css` (instead of `/MagazinesWebsite/assets/...`)
- ✅ `/assets/index-CuRk5OvW.js` (instead of `/MagazinesWebsite/assets/...`)
- ✅ `/vite.svg` (instead of `/MagazinesWebsite/vite.svg`)

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**:
   - Go to your frontend Vercel project
   - Check the latest deployment logs
   - Look for any build errors

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly
   - Check that all required variables are present

3. **Test Locally First**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   This will help identify if the issue is with the build or deployment.

## Files Modified

- `client/src/constants/blogConstants.ts` - Fixed all image paths
- `client/vite.config.ts` - Updated build configuration
- `client/vercel.json` - Updated routing rules

The main issue was that the `blogConstants.ts` file had hardcoded paths with the old base path. Now all paths are relative to the root, which should work correctly on Vercel.
